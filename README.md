# Portfolio Project 3: Arrived web scraper

### - Through this project, I learned how to navigate html to build a web scraper to automate the collection of listing data from arrivedhomes.com!
### - Using the selenium library in Python, I build a bot to collect links to all the listings on the Arrived Homes website, then scrape useful information off of each of the listings
### - Vacation Rentals contain slightly different web pages, so I had to scrape the data from those and single-family-home listings differently
