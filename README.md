# Portfolio Project 3: Arrived web scraper
## I learned how to navigate html to build a web scraper to automate the collection oflisting data from arrivedhomes.com!

#### - Using the selenium library in Python, I build a bot to collect links to all the listings on the Arrived Homes website, then scrape useful information off of each of the listings
