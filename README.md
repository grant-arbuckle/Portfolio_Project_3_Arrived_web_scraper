# Portfolio Project 3: Arrived web scraper

### - Through this project, I learned how to navigate html to build a web scraper to automate the collection of listing data from arrivedhomes.com. I wanted to diversify my investments, so I decided to pursue real estate, and Arrived is a platform that allows investors to purchase shares of rental properties and avoid the involved legal aspect of property ownership. 
### - Using the selenium library in Python, I build a bot to collect links to all the listings on the Arrived Homes website, then scrape useful information off of each of the listings
### - Vacation Rentals contain slightly different web pages, so I had to scrape the data from those and single-family-home listings differently
### - Once the listing data is scraped, it is saved in a pandas dataframe, which is output in its raw form to an excel or csv file to be used in future analysis
